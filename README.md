# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and monitor employee attrition patterns using interactive Power BI visualizations. By leveraging DAX calculations, data modeling, and KPI tracking, the dashboard provides actionable insights into workforce demographics, job roles, salary ranges, tenure, and departmental impacts.
This enables HR teams to identify key attrition drivers, predict future risks, and design targeted retention strategies to improve employee satisfaction and organizational stability.
